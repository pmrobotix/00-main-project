\subsection{Detailed Description}
based on Chipmunk \hyperlink{structcpArray}{cp\+Array}. cc\+Array is a faster alternative to N\+S\+Mutable\+Array, it does pretty much the same thing (stores N\+S\+Objects and retains/releases them appropriately). It\textquotesingle{}s faster because\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item it uses a plain C interface so it doesn\textquotesingle{}t incur Objective-\/c messaging overhead
\item it assumes you know what you\textquotesingle{}re doing, so it doesn\textquotesingle{}t spend time on safety checks (index out of bounds, required capacity etc.)
\item comparisons are done using pointer equality instead of is\+Equal
\end{DoxyItemize}

There are 2 kind of functions\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item cc\+Array functions that manipulates objective-\/c objects (retain and release are performed)
\item cc\+C\+Array functions that manipulates values like if they were standard C structures (no retain/release is performed) 
\end{DoxyItemize}
