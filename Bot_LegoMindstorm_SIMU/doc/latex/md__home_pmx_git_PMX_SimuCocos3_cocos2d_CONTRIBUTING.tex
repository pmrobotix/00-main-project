\subsection*{Reporting bugs}

To report bugs, please use the \href{https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues}{\tt Issue Tracker}

Steps to report a bug\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Open the \href{https://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x/issues/new}{\tt url}
\item Add all the needed information to reproduce the bug, the information include
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item engine version
\item steps to reproduce the bug
\item some pseudocode
\item resources link if needed
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Submitting patches}

If you want to contribute code, please follow these steps\+:

(If you are new to git and/or Git\+Hub, you should read \href{http://progit.org/book/}{\tt Pro Git} , especially the section on \href{http://progit.org/book/ch5-2.html#public_small_project}{\tt Contributing to a project\+:Small/\+Large Public Project} )


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Download the latest cocos2d-\/x develop branch from github\+:
\end{DoxyItemize}


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ git clone git://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-x.git
$ cd cocos2d-x
$ git checkout v3
$ ./download-deps.py
$ git submodule update --init
\end{DoxyCode}



\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Apply your changes in the recently downloaded repository
\item Commit your changes in your own repository
\item Create a new branch with your patch\+: {\ttfamily \$ git checkout -\/b my\+\_\+fix\+\_\+branch}
\item Push your new branch to your public repository
\item Send a “pull request” to user “cocos2d”
\item It must be {\itshape complete}. See the definition below
\item It must follow the {\itshape Releases} rules. See the definition below
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Only {\itshape complete} patches will be merged}

The patch must be {\itshape complete}. And by that, we mean\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item For C++ code follow the https\+://github.com/cocos2d/cocos2d-\/x/blob/v3/docs/\+C\+O\+D\+I\+N\+G\+\_\+\+S\+T\+Y\+L\+E.\+md \char`\"{}\+Cocos2d C++ Coding Style\char`\"{}
\item For Python code follow the \href{https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008}{\tt P\+E\+P8 guidelines}
\item Describe what the patch does
\item Include test cases if applicable
\item Include unit tests if applicable
\item Must be tested in all supported platforms \mbox{[}$\ast$\mbox{]}
\item Must N\+OT degrade the performance
\item Must N\+OT break existing tests cases
\item Must N\+OT break the Continuous Integration build
\item Must N\+OT break backward compatibility
\item Must compile W\+I\+T\+H\+O\+UT warnings
\item New A\+P\+Is M\+U\+ST be {\bfseries easy to use}, {\bfseries familiar} to cocos2d-\/x users
\item Code M\+U\+ST be {\bfseries easy to extend} and {\bfseries maintain}
\item Must have documentation\+: C++ A\+P\+Is must use Doxygen strings, tools must have a R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+md file that describe how to use the tool
\item Must be efficient (fast / low memory needs)
\item It must not duplicate existing code, unless the new code deprecates the old one
\item Patches that refactor key components will only be merged in the next major versions.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\mbox{[}$\ast$\mbox{]}\+: If you don\textquotesingle{}t have access to test your code in all the supported platforms, let us know.

{\bfseries T\+BD}\+: Is this applicable for big features ? What is the best way to merge big features ?
