fbxconverter version 0.\+4 It is for cocos2d-\/x after version v3.\+3

Convert .fbx to .c3t used by cocos2d-\/x. Thanks to libgdx fbx-\/conv. We use their code and do some change.

You can get the source code from the address below\+: \href{https://github.com/lvlonggame/cocos2d-x-3rd-party-libs-src}{\tt https\+://github.\+com/lvlonggame/cocos2d-\/x-\/3rd-\/party-\/libs-\/src}

U\+S\+A\+GE\+:

Open a command line and enter into the fbx-\/conv directory, and then input the full path fbx-\/conv file (you can drag fbx-\/conv to command line directly) and then enter the parameters -\/a (-\/a means export both of c3t and c3b file, if parameter is empty we export c3b file by default), and then enter the file name which you want to convert.

\hyperlink{classCommand}{Command} line\+: cd \mbox{[}path of fbx-\/conv\mbox{]} xx/xx/fbx-\/conv \mbox{[}options\mbox{]} $<$input$>$

For example\+:
\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item cd /\+Users/xx/cocos2d-\/x-\/3rd-\/party-\/libs-\/bin/fbx-\/conv/mac
\item /\+Users/xx/cocos2d-\/x-\/3rd-\/party-\/libs-\/bin/fbx-\/conv/mac/fbx-\/conv -\/a boss.\+F\+BX
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

You can use the -\/? option to see more help information.

Note\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Model need to have a material that contain one texture in the diffuse-\/channel at least.
\item About animation, we just support skeletal animation.
\item Just one skeletal animation object and no support multiple skeleton.
\item You can export multiple static model , so you can support a static scene.
\item The maximum amount of vertices or indices a mesh should less than 32767.
